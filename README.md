# Summary
My **[accepted]** WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2022 submission is about information security and its main goals are to give a brief introduction to the subject and make the user aware of the importance of having good digital security practices, in a realistic and funny way. 

To achieve these goals, a minimalist and intuitive design based on the macOS and iOS operating systems composed by a mix between terminal (command line) and graphical interface guides the user through informative challenges that they will see to complete the interactive scene.
